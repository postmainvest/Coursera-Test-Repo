    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline  of your page. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in it's own "li"</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Coding is fun -->

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything.</li>
        <li>But, the list items elements are the same.</li>
        <li>Also notice how the number increment on their own.</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order because it is an ordered list.</li>

    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

  <!--(Don't ever do this) -->

    <p>This is some <em><b>emphasized text.</b></em></p>

    <p>For other elements you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly empasize a word or a phrase</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</em></strong></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be easier now.</p>

  <!-- Don't abuse the line break -->

    <p>Regards,<br/><br/>
